# Fixed-Wing-arduino-Autopilot
Implementation of an Arduino-based autopilot for aircraft control, featuring functionalities such as Auto-takeoff, Auto-landing, and Altitude-hold.
# Problem(s) and motivation
When flying an aircraft in the manual mode, the flight is less safe and hence subject to many undesirable behaviors suchs aerodynamic stall, a high bank angle or even changing route due to external pertubation such as change in wind speed and direction as demonstrated in video below. Another problem emerges when the pilot himself is not well-trained on the newly built model which was my case in the video.

Here, I have mistakenly cut off the powers at that very moment when the plane needed its maximum thrust to take-off from the ground. Because I thought it will divert from the runway and hit the grass causing consequently damage to the propeller.

On this windy day, the weather conditions affected significantly the route of the plane and diverted it to the opposite direction. I could have been quicker to respond by applying elevator up before crashing into the field.
